## Testing

Run all tests:

php artisan test

Run specific test suite:

php artisan test --filter AuthenticationTest

With coverage (requires Xdebug):

php artisan test --coverage

## Error Handling

All errors return consistent JSON responses:

{
	"success": false,
	"message": "Error message",
	"errors": {
		"field": ["validation error"]
	}
}


HTTP Status Codes:
- `200`: Success
- `201`: Created
- `400`: Bad Request
- `401`: Unauthorized
- `403`: Forbidden
- `404`: Not Found
- `422`: Validation Error
- `500`: Server Error

If given more time, I would implement:

### Technical Enhancements
1. Caching: Implement Redis caching for healthcare professional listings to improve performance.
2. Queue System: Utilize Laravel queues for sending email notifications for appointments.
3. Logging: Comprehensive logging using Monolog for better monitoring and debugging.

### Additional Feature
4. Search & Filters: Advanced search functionality by specialty, location, and ratings.
5. Ratings: Allow patients to provide feedback and rate healthcare professionals.
6. Calendar Integration: Integrate with Google Calendar or similar services for appointment syncing.
7. Email & SMS Notifications: Send appointment confirmations, reminders, and notifications via email and SMS.
8. Healthcare Professional Dashboard: Analytics and reporting features for individual professionals.
9. Admin Panel: Dashboard for managing the system, viewing reports, and monitoring appointments.
